Sleep Debt Calculator
Did you know that giraffes sleep only 4.6 hours a day? We humans need more than that. If we don’t get enough sleep, we accumulate sleep debt, which can affect our health and well-being. In this project, we’ll create a sleep debt calculator to determine if you're getting enough sleep each week.

The program will:

Determine the Actual Hours of Sleep: Gather data on the number of hours you slept each night over the last week.
Determine the Ideal Hours of Sleep: Allow you to set your ideal number of hours of sleep per night.
Calculate the Sleep Debt: Compare your actual sleep hours to your ideal sleep hours and calculate the total sleep debt or surplus for the week.
Finally, the program will display how many hours you are from your weekly sleep goal, helping you understand your sleep patterns and make adjustments if necessary.
